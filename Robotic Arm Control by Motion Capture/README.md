# Project Introduction

## Description

In this project, we have developed an innovative control system for a robotic arm using motion capture technology.

## Context

This project is part of a professional and personal initiative aimed at exploring the potential applications of a robotic arm controlled by motion capture. 
This approach is of interest not only in the leisure sector, providing an interactive experience, but also in more sensitive areas such as industrial chemistry, where it can minimize operators exposure to hazardous materials.

## Work Areas
We will address two major areas of importance:
1. *Robotic Arm:* A thorough literature review will be conducted, covering a general presentation of robotic arms, their application domains, and different types of manipulator arms.

2. *Motion Capture:* A theoretical exploration of the motion capture principle will be carried out, highlighting its advantages, disadvantages, application domains, and the methods used.

## Hardware Used
- *Microcontroller*: Arduino Uno [link](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3)
