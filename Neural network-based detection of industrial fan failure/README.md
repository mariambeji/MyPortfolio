# Neural network-based detection of industrial fan failure  
## Summary
First, our task was to familiarize ourselves with the environment of development linked to the board used “STM32 Discovery kit IoT Node” and to discover the
different sensors present to extract the data. Secondly, we started to explore the broad outlines of artificial intelligence, more precisely Deep Learning. This
which quite naturally led us to choose the following application for our final project of year: Fan anomaly detection in an industrial environment based on
of “Deep Learning”. Finally, it was a question of processing the “Dataset” used, training a “Deep Learning” model and implement it on the microcontroller.
  
## Full report:
The report was written in French and it includes all the parts of the project conducted in a group of four people: Khalil Kaanich, Taher Bazzazi, Imed Ben Slimene and myself.
