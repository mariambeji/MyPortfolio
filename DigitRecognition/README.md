# DigitRecognition

## Summary 
This project was initially destined for robotic applications, this folder here includes the parts of the work I did.
The cv2 python library was used to manipulate and preprocess the images.  
The cv::ml::KNearest::findNearest was used to find the neighbors and predicts responses for input vectors.
For each input vector (a row of the matrix samples), the method finds the k nearest neighbors. In case of regression, the predicted result is a mean value of the particular vector's neighbor responses. In case of classification, the class is determined by voting.  
3 classes were built:  
1- picture: for customised preprocessing  
2- DigitRecognizerTraining: for training the model manually  
3- DigitRecognizerTesting: To give the model an image and test if the result is correct  

## Keywords:
