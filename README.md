## MyPortfolio

# Welcome to my Professional Gallery!
This portfolio repository contains examples of my work in the field of embedded systems development.

## About me :
Hi, My name is Mariam Beji and I am a junior Embedded Systems Engineer, graduated recently with an engineering dipoloma in Industrial Computing and Automation, and currently finishing a Master in Complex and Intelligent Systems. My enthusiasm for the field of embedded systems is shown here through the projects I built for academic and personal purposes.  
  
During my journey, I learned and practiced the programming languages **C/C++ , Python and Matlab**. I have a solid understanding of ARM architecture and experience with several microcontrollers: _Arduino,  STM32, XMOS xCORE, Pi Pico_.  
Other than the project described in this portfolio I have acquired more experience in programming on STM32 during the practical classes we had in school and during the trainings I did with my club: IEEE INSAT student branch and specifically the Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) student branch chapter. 
In addition to these technical tools, I have also acquired knowledge in control theory and automation and put it into practice by tuning PIDs for autonomous robots.   
  
Moreover, my ability to adapt easily to change allowed me to work on a new SoC for the first time during my internship with **Synapticon**, and I could contribute efficiently to their project.  
Now, I am currently finishing my internship with **Airbus** focusing on developing SDK tool and methodology for easy integration of Simulink models on critical ECUs on board civil aircraft.

While going through my project folders you can notice that I have a passion for Computer Vision and Imagery. That comes from my interest in Photography and Visual Arts in general. So I invite you to also visit my Personal Gallery: [SourdiMan9oub](https://www.instagram.com/sourdiman9oub/)
